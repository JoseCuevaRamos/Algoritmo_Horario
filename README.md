# Optimized Scheduling Application Using Genetic Algorithms
The application is designed to assist in creating schedules by taking into account the availability of teachers, the required hours for each course, and the available classrooms. It formulates schedules for students, allowing them to select the courses they wish to take. The application uses genetic algorithms to optimize the timetable generation process, ensuring that all constraints and preferences are efficiently met for both faculty and students.
